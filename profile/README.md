  ***Hedge any exotic FX pair***

  Numo is a novel portfolio management system that enables dynamic hedging of exotic FX pairs such as `USD/ARS` and `USD/NGN` that are traditionally hard to hedge due to a lack of liquidity. With Numo, businesses and individuals can now transact in any local currency without having to worry about exchange rate volatility.
