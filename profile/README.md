**Numo is a hedging solution for FX markets.** Foreign currencies such as the Kenyan Schilling (KES) are traditionally hard to hedge due to minimal liquidity in their derivative instruments. Numo addresses this problem by offering a solution that eliminates the reliance on liquid derivative markets and at a significantly lower cost to traditional hedging methods.
